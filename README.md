# Summary
These are MCMC samplers and processing and run scripts for an inhomogenous Poisson point process model to integrate detection/non-detection data and presence-only data to estimate the expected abundance of species. This model enables the user to intergrate these two datatypes by assuming they share the same underlying data generating process (an inhomogeneous Poisson point process). These models are adapted from Koshkina et al. (2017) [Methods in Ecology and Evolution] but diverge from the original specification to accomodate _t_ primary sampling periods (survey years). This model fits temporally varying mean-centered random year effects of all three parameters in the model (detection probability, p, mean expected abundance, Î», and thinning, b).
